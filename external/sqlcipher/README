HOW TO

1) copy the libs folder into your project. If you are targeting below 4.0, include the 'icudt46l.zip' in the assets folder as well.

2) Update your import path from android.database to info.guardianproject.database and you are almost there!

3) then when you open your database, just pass a variable argument to the open database method with your password:
	
	SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context
	SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase("thisismysecret"):

4) run your app to ensure all the libraries are being loaded correctly, and that your app runs.

5) You will need to implement a passcode entry user interface to your application, as well. 
The longer the passcode, the better.
